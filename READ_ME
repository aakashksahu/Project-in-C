THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ONLY FOR ADMIN(the person who looks after the slash shell).

-> ADMIN must create the following directories before using slash shell.
   1./tmp/Slash
   2./tmp/Slash/chat    ---This directory stores the chatting files of the users.
   3./tmp/Slash/bin     ---This directory contains the commands which work in slash.

***In project_Slash directory,there are 3 directories named data,bin,source.
***In the directory data,(.quotes),(.wits),(.end) files are found.(.quotes) and (.wits) are to be moved to /tmp/Slash
    directory and (.end) must be moved to /usr/bin directory.
***bin directory contains object files whereas source contains source code in (.c)files.    
***All the executable files can be found in Slash directory.


->ADMIN must keep executable ->(admin)<- in his folder.This executable allows the ADMIN to create users in Slash shell.
 ADMIN must collect username of the shell(bash) in which they are working in and their date of birth to create a user
 in  slash shell.   

->ADMIN must keep Slash executable in /usr/bin directory 
  and chatter,cnvrt,flashmail,myage,password,quote,shist,smail,susers,volume,wit into /tmp/Slash/bin directory.

   of the cube. Then the result is displayed.
   The other shapes that can be used are sphere,hemisphere,cuboid,cone,etc...

1.Use signal handler to ignore interrupt in shell.

2.Implementation of history using arrow keys.

3.Verify the existence of bash user before creating slash user.
